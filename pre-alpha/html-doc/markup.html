<h3>Markup Copy</h3>

<p>When your <a href="purpose.html">purpose</a> is <code>markup</code>,
the generated PDF file will have "MARKUP COPY" in small gray letters,
at the upper left (in the clearance area) of each page.</p>
<p>Also, the internal PDF Metadata title will have "MARKUP COPY" added to
the end of the real title.</p>
<p>The markup copy can be annotated in a PDF reader, or printed at your
home or office. It is not for transfer to your P.O.D. Service.</p>
<p>These settings apply <i>only</i> when your purpose is markup.
They are ignored when your purpose is book or cover, so they can remain
in the Preamble without harm.</p>
<p>The two commands on this page are independent. You may use one, both,
or neither.</p>

<h4>\media{markup}{width}{height}</h4>
<p>This command is optional. Width and height must have units of
mm, cm, or in. If you do not use this command, then the markup copy
will have the same dimensions as the book trim size.</p>
<p>The <code>media</code> refers to the size of paper on which the document
will be printed (before trimming), not the size of the book (after trimming).
In nearly all cases, your book trim size is smaller than the size of paper
that you feed into into the printer. Some printers automatically know
what to do about this. Others will ask you what to do. But if you set
the media, then the printer has its instructions built into the file.</p>
<p>When you set <code>media</code>, the book trim size will be centered
horizontally and vertically in the media size. Note that the texts will
appear to shift slightly from right to left, for odd and even pages.
This is due to the extra width of the inside clearance (glue area).</p>
<p>When you use this command, crop marks will be added beyond the four
corners of the book trim area, so you know how much of the media is
actually occupied by the book pages.</p>
<p>There is another media setting, when the purpose is book. It does not
interact with this command.</p>

<h4>\markupgrid{choice}</h4>
<p>This command is optional. If you use it, the <code>choice</code>
must be one of <code>mm</code> or <code>in</code>. Or, you can
turn it off with <code>none</code>.</p>
<p>If the choice is <code>mm</code>, then a grid with 2mm spacing will
appear in the background at each corner of the trim size. If the choice
is <code>in</code>, then a grid with 0.125in spacing will appear in the
background at each corner of the trim size. The grids are labeled,
so you know which one you selected.</p>
<p>Each grid has its outermost square darkened, so you can readily find
the four corners of the trim size.</p>
<p>The grids are independently positioned, aligned with their four corners.</p>
<p>If you use this command, but do not see the grids, perhaps the necessary
grid images could not be found. Or perhaps you mis-spelled the choice.
Either way, your file will be processed with warning, not error.</p>
