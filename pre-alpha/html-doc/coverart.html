<h3>Cover Artwork</h3>

<h4><code>
\template{number}{name} % SAME AS WHEN YOU WROTE THE BOOK.
\purpose{cover}<br>
\spine{width}<br>
\bleed{width}<br>
\coverimage{filename}</code></h4>
<p>Before you begin: Cover artwork requires a real computer.
The file size is large, and the amount of computation is heavy.
If you are tying to do it on a portable device with only solid-state
storage (no hard drive) and limited memory, you will fail. You do not
need fancy technology; an ordinary home or office computer can do it.</p>
<p>Novelette is not an image editor or graphic arts program. But if you
have the cover artwork as an image file, it can do these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-process the image using shell scripts (BASH or Windows CMD).
The result will be a preliminary PDF file, with the image separated into
CMYK channels, and ink limit common to many P.O.D. Services.</li>
<li>Convert the preliminary PDF into a PDF/X conforming file</p>
</ul>

<p>The use of the scripts is explained on a different page. That work
occurs outside the scope of LuaLaTeX.</p>
<p>When your book is finished, you will tell the P.O.D. Service its page
count, and they will reply with a spine width. Or, they may provide
a do-it-yourself calculator. Enter it as <code>\spine{width}</code>
with units of <code>mm</code>, <code>cm</code>, or <code>in</code>.</p>
<p>The P.O.D. Service will also require a minimum bleed width, typically
0.125in or 3mm. Enter it, with units, as <code>\bleed{width}</code>.
It is applied on all sides of the image.</p>
<p>The cover image <code>filename</code> must show its file extension.
It must be in the same folder as the LuaLaTeX document, or as
<i>subfolder/filename</i>.<p>
<p>When the image is pre-processed by Novelette scripts, an internal label
is added, which says the image is OK. If the document does not see that label,
it will refuse to convert the image.</p>
<p>The document will also measure the image size, with its required 300ppi
resolution, and compare it to the dimensions provided.
If the calculation is correct, the image is converted. But if the numbers
do not add up, error.</p>
<p>The document body must be <i>entirely empty</i>. That is, there must be
nothing (except maybe a blank line) between <code>\begin{document}</code>
and <code>\end{document}</code>. In other words, you cannot use LuaLaTeX
to add text onto the image. All text must be built into the image
(rasterized). This is not the most advanced way to do things, but the
more advanced ways requires professional knowledge. If you had that
knowledge, you would be using a professional graphic arts program!</p>
<p>Things you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-value colors, and pastels, will appear about as good as you
would get using professional methods, with the same P.O.D. technology.</li>
<li>Dark colors will not appear as dark as you might like. This is because
P.O.D. Services limit the amount of ink (total area coverage, TAC)
and the kind of ink (no spot colors). Mass-produced books, with those
dramatic cover colors, are printed using a different technology.</li>
<li>Text will be adequately sharp, if it is not too thin or too tiny.
If you are using light text on a dark background, then use text that is
a bit heavier or larger than usual. Handling text in CMYK is one of
those things that separates the pros from anyone else.</li>
<li>You are not using a color-profiled monitor with color-calibrated
software in a controlled environment, to be printed on a machine
with known color response. In fact, you may not even know what those
terms mean. Bottom line: The printed colors will be OK, but do not
expect them to be exactly what you saw on your computer.</li>
</ul>
