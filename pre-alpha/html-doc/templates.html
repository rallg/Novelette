<h3>Templates</h3>

<p>Novelette provides templates for several popular US and UK book sizes.
The processed PDF is acceptable by nearly all P.O.D. Services.</p>

<p>Novelette cannot use word processor templates (such as those designed
for MS Word). It cannot export your document to a word processor format.</p>
<p>Some P.O.D. Services provide MS Word templates, for the convenience
of writers who use a word processor. That is not a problem, as long as
you can ignore the MS Word template, and submit a finished PDF file.</p>

<p>If you employ an Editor who requests an MS Word document for editing,
that may or may not be a problem. If the edited text is returned to you for
final changes, you can export the Word document to UTF-8 plain text (no BOM)
then markup the text according to Novelette requirements. The risk is that
you will fumble the markup! But if you are using an Editor who accepts PDF,
and returns an annotated PDF to you, then you can use Novelette directly.</p> 

<p>If your P.O.D. Service does not accept PDF, consider using another Service.
It seems to be that case some P.O.D. Services are really in the business of
E-books, with print-to-paper as a nuisance sideline.</p>


<h4>Available Trim Sizes</h4>
<p>Novelette understands only a few sizes, which are among the most popular
industry standards offered by P.O.D. Services.</p>
<p>Note that the small Pocket and A-Format sizes are not available.
This is because P.O.D. often requires clearances that are unusually large
for these formats, leaving an undesirably small printable area.
Besides, the modern equivalent is a smartphone with E-book reader!</p>
<p>Size names "Novella" and "Memoir" are nicknames used by some Services;
no particular content is implied. The other names are industry standards.</p>
<p>Sizes are listed in order of increasing width. Note that some services
list sizes with height shown first. Height always exceeds width.</p>
<p>P.O.D. Services usually require clearance (margin) of at least 0.5in
or 13mm on all sides of the printable area, with an additional 0.125in
or 3mm at the inside (spine) edge, where pages are glued. These values
are built into the templates. You do not need to set them. However, you may
visually balance top/bottom clearances, using the optional
<a href="upshift.html">upshift</a> setting.</p>
<p>You do not set font point size, or lines per page. These are automatically
set by the template.</p>

<h4>Available Templates</h4>
<h5><code>\template{group number}{named size}</code></h5>
<p>Templates are grouped as number 1, 2, 3. Each group number is
compatible with several named sizes. Y9ou must choose both a number and
a named size. Most named sizes are available in more than one group number.</p>
<p>Within a group, you may change the named size, without affecting line
breaks or page numbering. So if you are not sure whether your book will
be printed as Novella or B-Format, choose group 1. But if you are not sure
whether your books will be printed as Digest or B-Format, choose group 2.</p>
<p>Note: A name change <i>should</i> always work, but possibly may result in
different line breaks and pagination. If it does, minor edits may fix it.</p>
