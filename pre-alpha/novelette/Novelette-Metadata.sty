%% This page only discusses user settings that are not automatically
%% calculated from templates, PDF/X, etc..

%% PDF Metadata is non-printing identifying information in the PDF file.
%% Some or all of it can be read by PDF reader software.
%% Examples are: Title, Author.

%% There are many more kinds PDF Metadata, such as subject and keywords.
%% They are used for database search of electronic documents, not paper print.
%% So, Novelette does not provide for that kind of PDF Metadata.
%% When you sign up with a P.O.D. Service, you will provide subject, keywords,
%% and description directly to their database, rather than in the PDF.

%% The print ISBN is not PDF Metadata, because you are not selling PDF copies.
%% Your P.O.D. Service may request that ISBN be part of the PDF file name,
%% or they may re-name your file by its ISBN. That makes it easy to locate.
%% From the manufacturing point of view, your book is its ISBN, with cover
%% associated to that ISBN.

%% Believe it or not, the Copyright is undefined in Novelette PDF Metadata.
%% This is because the PDF is privately transferred between yourself
%% and the P.O.D. Service (and Editor, if you use one). It is not published.
%% Actual book Copyright notice is printed on its Copyright page.
%% Particularly note that your P.O.D. Service is NOT the publisher: YOU are!
