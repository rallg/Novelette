Novelette, a simplified LuaLaTeX document class for fiction writers.

MIT License.

Novelette largely includes code from the `novel' document class,
by the same author, which has been included in TeXlive for several years.
The included code is released in Novelette under the MIT License.

Any Open Type font(s) included with Novelette are licensed under the
SIL Open Font License, v1.1.

Portions of Novelette code have been shamelessly derived from
code written by others, Copyrighted by them, and released by them under
terms of the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3 or later (LPPL).
This license is available at:
http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

The derived code is identified and attributed where used in Novelette code.
Usage in Novelette complies with the relevant terms of the LPPL, and is
released within Novelette under the MIT License.

Why not simply \RequirePackage instead of derived code?
Much current work in LaTeX (especially in LuaLaTeX) is for digital documents,
rather than paper prints. The needs of digital documents and paper prints are
very different, and often in conflict.

There are also some code snippets based on answers to questions posed in
online forums, where the terms of the forum permit free usage.
The snippets are identified and attributed, where used in Novelette.
